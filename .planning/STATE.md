# Project State

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Migration order is Vite -> React 19 -> Tailwind v4 -> shadcn/ui -> UX -> Polish (strict dependency chain)
- [Roadmap]: Tailwind v4 migration is isolated into its own phase due to 12+ breaking changes and silent class rename failures

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tailwind v4 theme() function replacement needs manual work (Phase 3 risk)
- shadcn/ui CLI support for JavaScript (not TypeScript) projects needs verification (Phase 4 risk)
- framer-motion v12 + React 19 compatibility untested (Phase 2 risk)
