## Overview of Cheminformatics Micro Services
- This set of essential and valuable microservices is designed to be accessed via API calls to support cheminformatics. Generally, it is designed to work with SMILES-based inputs and could be used to translate between different machine-readable representations, get Natural Product (NP) likeliness scores, visualize chemical structures, and generate descriptors. In addition, the microservices also host an instance of [STOUT](https://github.com/Kohulan/Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator) and another instance of [DECIMER](https://github.com/Kohulan/DECIMER-Image_Transformer) (two deep learning models for IUPAC name generation and optical chemical structure recognition, respectively).
