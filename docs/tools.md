# TOOLS Module

Tools developed based on cheminformatics toolkits but not packaged with the original distribution are available under this category. Examples include sugar removal utilities based on CDK and structure generators based on SURGE. These implementations preview how easy it is to extend the microservice to implement custom routines and expose them via REST API to be integrated as a part of the existing software or workflows.
