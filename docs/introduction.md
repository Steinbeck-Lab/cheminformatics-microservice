The Cheminformatics Python Microservice offers a collection of versatile functions accessible via REST endpoints that can handle chemical data and perform various cheminformatics tasks. These tasks include generating chemical structure depictions, 3D conformers, descriptors, IUPAC names, and converting machine-readable formats. Researchers and developers can effectively access open-source cheminformatics toolkits through these microservices and extend them easily based on their use case. 

This microservice packaged a docker image (container) enables effortless deployment and scalability, making them suitable for academic research and industry applications. Because of their modular nature, these microservices can be customized and combined to meet various needs in cheminformatics research and chemical data analysis.

> **Note:** The microservices are hosted at [Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de) in Germany. You can utilize the Docker image to run the microservices locally. The source code is open-source and accessible on GitHub under a permissive license.
