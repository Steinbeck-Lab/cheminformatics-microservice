# Cheminformatics Python Microservice

<div style="text-align: justify;">

This collection of vital and invaluable microservices is specifically crafted for cheminformatics support, accessible through API calls. Primarily optimized for SMILES-based inputs, these microservices facilitate tasks such as translating between various machine-readable representations, obtaining Natural Product (NP) likeliness scores, visualizing chemical structures, and generating descriptors. Additionally, within this microservice suite, there is an instance of [STOUT](https://github.com/Kohulan/Smiles-TO-iUpac-Translator) and another instance of [DECIMER](https://github.com/Kohulan/DECIMER-Image_Transformer), both of which are deep learning models utilized for IUPAC name generation and Optical Chemical Structure Recognition[(OCSR)](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-00465-0), respectively.

> **Note:** The microservices are hosted at [Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de) in Germany. You can utilize the Docker image to run the microservices locally. The source code is open-source and accessible on GitHub under a permissive license.
