<div style="text-align: justify;">
The Cheminformatics Microservice offers a collection of versatile functions accessible via REST endpoints that can handle chemical data and perform various cheminformatics tasks. These tasks include (but are not limited to) generating chemical structure depictions, 3D conformers, descriptors, IUPAC names, and converting machine-readable formats. Researchers and developers can effectively access open-source cheminformatics toolkits such as CDK, RDKit, and OpenBabel through this microservice and extend them easily.

This microservice packaged as a docker image (container) enables effortless deployment and scalability, making it suitable for academic, research and industry applications. Because of their modular nature, these microservices can be customized and combined to meet various Cheminformatics research and chemical data analysis needs.

## Front-end 

<div style="text-align: justify;">

The Cheminformatics Microservice features a modern React frontend that offers an intuitive user interface for a wide range of chemical informatics tasks. Key capabilities include chemical structure analysis and validation, format conversion (e.g., SMILES, InChI, IUPAC), and both 2D and interactive 3D molecular visualization. It also supports Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR), allowing conversion of chemical structure images into SMILES. Advanced analysis tools include structure validation, molecular descriptor calculation, stereoisomer generation, tautomer standardization, natural product likeness scoring, functional group detection, HOSE code generation, and Tanimoto similarity calculation. Users can perform batch operations and generate 2D/3D coordinates, making the platform robust for cheminformatics research and applications. The platform is publicly accessible at https://app.naturalproducts.net.
